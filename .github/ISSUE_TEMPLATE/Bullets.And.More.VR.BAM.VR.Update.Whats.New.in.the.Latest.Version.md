- **New game mode: BAM Royale.** This is a battle royale mode where up to 12 players compete to be the last one standing. Players start with a pistol and a knife, and have to scavenge for better weapons and items on the map. The map shrinks over time, forcing players to move closer to each other. The last player or team alive wins the match.
- **New maps: Airport and Warehouse.** These are two new maps that are available for all game modes. Airport is a large map with a lot of open space, vehicles, and buildings. Warehouse is a smaller map with crates, containers, and conveyor belts. Both maps offer different tactical opportunities and challenges for players.
- **New weapons: RPG-7 and M79.** These are two new explosive weapons that can deal massive damage to enemies and structures. The RPG-7 is a rocket launcher that fires a single powerful projectile. The M79 is a grenade launcher that fires multiple smaller grenades. Both weapons are rare and have limited ammo, so use them wisely.
- **New customization options: skins and hats.** Players can now customize their appearance with different skins and hats. Skins change the color and pattern of the player's outfit, while hats add various accessories to the player's head. There are over 50 skins and hats to choose from, ranging from military uniforms to animal costumes.
